    "What if you could have a more fluid, interactive conversation with AI? Enter **Dialog Engineering**, a groundbreaking approach that lets you construct and edit a dialogue with the AI in real-time.\n",

    "> Unlike prompt engineering where you're just creating a single sentence or paragraph or whatever, that's actually part of a whole back and forth dialog. All of the previous steps get sent to the AI model as well, not just the prompt. And they all greatly influence how it responds. And how it responds influences you as to what you then add to the dialog.\n",
